## Overview

This program is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to create lines, triangles, and circles by clicking on points within a window. It calculates and displays relevant geometric properties such as the slope of lines, the area of triangles, and the area of circles.

## Features

- **Line Drawing:** Users can draw a specified number of lines and see their slopes.
- **Triangle Drawing:** Users can create triangles and calculate their area based on the coordinates of the three vertices.
- **Circle Drawing:** Users can draw circles and calculate their area based on the center and a point on the circumference.
- **Decorative Borders:** The graphical window includes a decorative border and an introduction screen.

## Instructions

1. **Run the Program:** Start the application in your Python environment.
2. **Enter Shapes:** Follow the prompts to enter the number of lines, triangles, or circles you want to draw.
3. **Click Points:** Click on the points in the window to define the geometric shapes.
4. **View Results:** After each shape is drawn, the program will display the corresponding geometric properties.
5. **Navigate:** Press any key when prompted to proceed through the different sections of the program.
6. **Finish:** At the end of the program, a closing message will be displayed before the window closes.

## Dependencies

- This program requires the `graphics.py` library for the graphical interface.
- Ensure that the images used for the borders and backgrounds are available in the same directory as the program.

## Note

Ensure that your Python environment is set up correctly and that the required images are present in the working directory for the program to function properly.

## Enjoy creating geometric shapes!
